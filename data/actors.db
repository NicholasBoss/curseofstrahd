Note: Please see below the entry for “Spider” which will suffice for the description of this creature.  Please note that “Giant” is a relative term and this creature is only giant in relative terms to its common size.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Spiders are one of the smallest, yet most feared, denizens of our planet.  Spiders are arachnids with eight thin legs protruding from their dual-segmented body.  Atop the spider's tiny head are eight glistening eyes with which it views the world in relative obscurity.  While the spider's eyesight may be poor regardless of the number of eyes, they have a clever trick up their sleeves: the spider's web!</p>\n<p><strong>Some Bug.</strong> Ingenious little architects, spiders produce a silken thread from their rears dubbed “webbing” which they use to construct elaborate homes.  Resembling something of a net, the spider's web serves a dual purpose: to capture food upon its sticky surface and to give the spider a safe place to perch away from predators.  Once an insect is trapped within the web, the spider quickly wraps the unsuspecting creature in a bundle of webbing, saving its prize for later consumption.  While all spiders are venomous in some capacity, many will not be harmful to the adventurer on their travels.  Simply avoid webs where you see them and be quite sure that the web which you see only belongs to a standard spider species, as a plethora of gigantic and magical varieties also lurk within similar webs!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope

It appears like a translucent version of its living self.<br /><br /><strong><em>Task Driven.</em></strong> Although one is often mistaken for a ghost, a phantom warrior isn’t bound by a yearning to complete some unresolved goal. It can choose to end its undead existence at any time. Its spirit lingers willingly, either out of loyalty to its former master or because it believes it must perform a task to satisfy its honor or sense of duty. For example, a guard who dies defending a wall might return as a phantom warrior and continue guarding the wall, then disappear forever once a new guard assumes its post or the wall is destroyed. The period between the time it died and the time it rises as a phantom warrior is usually 24 hours.<br /><br /><strong><em>Faded Memories.</em></strong> A phantom warrior retains the alignment and personality it had before it died, and it remembers how it died. Memories of its life from shortly before it died are hazy, and older memories are forgotten. A phantom warrior can usually remember the last 1d10 + 10 days of its life; everything that happened before that is an impenetrable fog.<br /><br /><strong><em>Forceful Presence.</em></strong> Although they are incorporeal, phantom warriors can harness the energy around them to deflect incoming attacks and strike with great force. An invisible sheath of energy surrounds a phantom warrior’s ghostly armor, shields, and weapons, which become as hard as steel yet don’t impede the warrior’s ability to move through walls and other solid objects.<br /><br /><strong><em>Undead Nature.</em></strong> A phantom warrior doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br />","public":""},"alignment":"Any

class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">.</span></strong> As a bonus action, you issue a challenge that compels other creatures to do battle with you. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t willingly move more than 30 feet away from you. This effect ends on the creature if you are @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Incapacitated]{incapacitated} or die or if the creature is more than 30 feet away from you.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Inline-Subhead\">Turn the Tide</span><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">.</span></strong> As a bonus action, you can bolster injured creatures with your Channel Divinity. Each creature of your choice that can hear you within 30 feet of you regains hit points equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) if it has no more than half of its hit points.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Allegiance</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 7th level, when a creature within 5 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to magically substitute your own health for that of the target creature, causing that creature not to take the damage. Instead, you take the damage. This damage to you can’t be reduced or prevented in any way.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unyielding Spirit</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 15th level, you have advantage on saving throws to avoid becoming @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Paralyzed]{paralyzed} or @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Stunned]{stunned}.</p>\n\n<p><b>Exalted Champion</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body--Extra-Space-After-\">At 20th level, your presence on the field of battle is an inspiration to those dedicated to your cause. You can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 hour:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your allies have advantage on death saving throws while within 30 feet of you.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted--Extra-Space-After-\">You have advantage on Wisdom saving throws, as do your allies within 30 feet of you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">This effect ends early if you are @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Incapacitated]{incapacitated} or die.

As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">hallow</span> spell.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier.

You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-curseofstrahd-class-features.grL4fDmVoaN3Povc]{Fighting Style}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-curseofstrahd-class-features.MySbknfNIDl2CqmX]{Spellcasting}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See <span style=\"color:#99cc00\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color:#993366\"><a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"Spells Listing (Paladin)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=4&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span> for the paladin spell list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a holy symbol (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-curseofstrahd-class-features.Oy9Y40UJtSCzIfUP]{Divine Smite}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-curseofstrahd-class-features.FBioqNTETRR72DRT]{Divine Health}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-curseofstrahd-class-features.fukPPfonVZWTfCie]{Sacred Oath}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.</p>\n<h4 class=\"compendium-hr\">Oath Spells</h4>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.</p>\n<h4 class=\"compendium-hr\">Channel Divinity</h4>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-curseofstrahd-class-features.9qWyh3TTUiiQBE5O]{Ability Score Improvement}</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-curseofstrahd-class-features.K0LwLqYOVtAbHYtw]{Extra Attack}</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-curseofstrahd-class-features.g9pDCi0FjvPeVVkv]{Aura of Protection}</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1).

One of your commoner retainers is replaced by a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps <span class=\"No-Break\">you put it on).</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart — in a chaste sort of devotion. (This person could<span class=\"No-Break\"> be your bond.)</span></p> <div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\"> </div> <blockquote> <p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>VARIANT FEATURE: RETAINERS</strong></p> <p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If your character has a noble background, you may select this background feature instead of Position of Privilege.</p> <p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body-Last--apply-at-last-paragraph-\">You have the service of three retainers loyal to your family. These retainers can be attendants or messengers, and one might be a majordomo.

A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family’s care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.</p> <table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\"> <thead> <tr> <th>d8</th> <th style=\"text-align:left\">Personality Trait</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>1</td> <td class=\"left wrap\">My eloquent flattery makes everyone I talk to feel like the most wonderful and important person in the world.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td class=\"left wrap\">The common folk love me for my kindness and generosity.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td class=\"left wrap\">No one could doubt by looking at my regal bearing that I am a cut above the unwashed masses.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td class=\"left wrap\">I take great pains to always look my best and follow the latest fashions.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td class=\"left wrap\">I don’t like to get my hands dirty, and I won’t be caught dead in unsuitable accommodations.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>6</td> <td class=\"left wrap\">Despite my noble birth, I do not place myself above other folk.

Bats are a nocturnal creature prized by arcanists for their ability to navigate terrain in near total darkness. This alone makes them a prized choice for a summoned familiar. Varying from the size of a mouse to that of a house cat, bats have a unique feature amongst mammals: the gift of flight! Stretched thin between needle-thin boney “hands” are fleshy membranes which span out wide from the bat's delicate body, allowing the bats to take to the skies in search of insects and woodland fruits to indulge upon.</p>\n<p><strong>Chitter Chatter.</strong> Presumed blind by many from nonsense tales told to children, bats have eyesight nearly akin to our own, though notably less sharp. What makes these creatures truly unique is their ability to navigate in the pitch black of night. The bats utilize a series of chirps and screeches researchers have dubbed “echolocation” to pinpoint objects or prey within their flightpath. The echolocation chirps emitted by the bats bounce back towards the tiny creature's proportionally massive ears, allowing the bats to make split second corrections to their navigation without the aid of their eyes. It should be again noted that the bat makes a clever familiar choice, as they may navigate those places too dim and dangerous for our mortal eyes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten

Note:  Please see below the entry for “Rat” which will suffice for the description of this creature.  Please note that “Swarms” function slightly differently in combat than singular creatures.  Please use the rules for “Swarms” befitting your particular game system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Denizens of filth, scavengers in our sewers, and vectors of contaigens, no singular animal may present such an impact upon humanoid life as does the rat.  Common place from the sprawling urban metropolis to the tiny barn of a poor farmer, rats inhabit every nook and cranny they may scurry in to.  These small rodents, who can range in size from no bigger than your palm to the length of a forearm (with tail included) are quite ingenious little thieves.  Rats are able to compress their bodies in such a manner that they can fit through spaces as small as the gap in the bottom of your door.  Able to swim and navigate in the dark, some rats have been observed climbing out of small plumbing pipes, having scampered through the length of the tunnel to make it inside a merchant's abode.</p>\n<p><strong>Rats Off to You.</strong> While many may dismiss the rat as nothing more than a common pest, even those not utilized as magical familiars are highly intelligent little creatures.  Researchers have observed rats completing complex mazes, solving lever-action puzzles, and understanding the world around them to a degree unseen in other animals.  A clever street-dweller could certainly train a rat to filch food or a few shiny coins from an unwatched coin purse, should the rat get adequate reward itself.  Do be wise in your selection of companion, however, as some rats carry deadly diseases from insects that nestle in their short fur.  Along with its sharp, clinging claws, the rat packs a powerful bite thanks to its elongated incisor teeth.  Be observant, young hero, should you see a rat nearby, for the simple creature may house a secret within its black, unblinking eyes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope

members having originally rediscovered the secrets of hemocraft and refined them for combat against the scourge of undeath.</p><h1>Class Features</h1>\n\n<p><b>Rite of the Dawn</b></p>\n<p>When you join this order at 3rd level, you learn the Rite of the Dawn as part of your Crimson Rite feature. When you activate the Rite of the Dawn, the extra damage dealt by your rite is radiant damage. Additionally, while that rite is active on your weapon, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your weapon sheds bright light out to a range of 20 feet.</li>\n<li>You have resistance to necrotic damage.</li>\n<li>When you hit an undead creature with a weapon for which the Rite of the Dawn is active, you roll an additional hemocraft die when determining the extra damage from the rite.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Curse Specialist</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, you learn to master blood curses. You gain an additional use of your Blood Maledict feature. In addition, your blood curses can target any creature, whether it has blood or not.</p>\n\n<p><b>Aether Walk</b></p>\n<p>Upon reaching 7th level, at the start of your turn, you can magically step into the veil between the planes as long as you aren’t @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Incapacitated]{incapacitated}. You can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, as well as see and affect creatures and objects on the Ethereal Plane. You take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside an object.</p>\n<p>This feature lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Hemocraft modifier (minimum of 1 round). If you are inside an object when it ends, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and you take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you moved.</p>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. You can use Aether Walk twice between rests starting at 15th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Brand of Sundering</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 11th level, your Brand of Castigation exposes a fragment of your foe’s essence, leaving them vulnerable to your Crimson Rite feature. Whenever you hit a creature with a weapon for which you have an active crimson rite, you roll an additional hemocraft die when determining the extra damage from the rite. Additionally, if a branded creature has the Incorporeal Movement trait or a similar feature, it can’t move through creatures or objects while branded.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blood Curse of the Exorcist</b></p>\n<p>At 15th level, you hone your hemocraft to tear corruption from the minds and bodies of your allies—and to punish those responsible for it.

survive in more difficult climates than their short haired brethren, draft horses have stout, powerful legs and gargantuan hooves adept at clinging to the loose gravel of a mountain trail.  Many breeds of draft horse exist within the world, so the picky merchant is never without option should they entertain the idea of purchasing such a beast.  The draft horse is capable of moving loads up to

Dwellers of the coastal urban sprawl see the armored law keepers near daily as they patrol the streets, guard our gates, inspect shipments, and of course assist (or arrest) those citizens of their fair cities. However, the guard is not only bound by the gates and ramparts of a city's walls. Be they mercenary or professional, guards are often found patrolling the roads, either to sweep away stray packs of animals or bandits, or on alert to protect precious cargo or important citizens as they travel the less settled areas of the world. Much like the bandits and cultists who we have previously discussed in this tome, guards come in all varieties. Though many may seem to be highly trained and regimented, it should be considered that most guards see no more action than a tussle on the busy streets of a market or scattering a few bandit scavengers from an upturned wagon. Guards are not all the hardened and grizzled ex-military types we think of at the upper ranks of the orders. Be observant, young adventurer, and heed the warnings of the law, for while the guards may only be a minor threat to your dastardly visions, what lays in wait in the city dungeon may not be worth the risks!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any Alignment","race":null,"type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":null,"cr":0.125,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"MM pg. 347","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"any one language (usually Common)"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"name":"Guard","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/Guard.webp","actorId":"E9CvDPDg5dFEpVjS","alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}}},"items":[{"_id":"2reHgwNJRFbhmxqA","name":"Chain Shirt","type":"equipment","img":"icons/equipment/chest/breastplate-metal-scaled-grey.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather.

divine source that glimmers within the soul. Having such a blessed soul is a sign that your innate magic might come from a distant but powerful familial connection to a divine being. Perhaps your ancestor was an angel, transformed into a mortal and sent to fight in a god’s name. Or your birth might align with an ancient prophecy, marking you as a servant of the gods or a chosen vessel of divine magic.</p><h1>Class Features</h1>\n\n<p><b>Divine Magic</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your link to the divine allows you to learn spells from the cleric class. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn or replace a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the cleric spell list or the sorcerer spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body--Extra-Space-After- ParaOverride-3\">In addition, choose an affinity for the source of your divine power: good, evil, law, chaos, or neutrality. You learn an additional spell based on that affinity, as shown below. It is a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against your number of sorcerer spells known. If you later replace this spell, you must replace it with a spell from the cleric spell list.</p>\n<div class=\"table-overflow-wrapper\">\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Affinity</th>\n<th>Spell</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Good</td>\n<td><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">cure wounds</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Evil</td>\n<td><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">inflict wounds</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Law</td>\n<td><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">bless</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chaos</td>\n<td><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">bane</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Neutrality</td>\n<td><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">protection from evil and good</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n\n<p><b>Favored by the Gods</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 1st level, divine power guards your destiny. If you fail a saving throw or miss with an attack roll, you can roll 2d4 and add it to the total, possibly changing the outcome. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Empowered Healing</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 6th level, the divine energy coursing through you can empower healing spells. Whenever you or an ally within 5 feet of you rolls dice to determine the number of hit points a spell restores, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll any number of those dice once, provided you aren’t @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Incapacitated]{incapacitated}. You can use this feature only once per turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Otherworldly Wings</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 14th level, you can use a bonus action to manifest a pair of spectral wings from your back. While the wings are present, you have a flying speed of 30 feet. The wings last until you’re @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Incapacitated]{incapacitated}, you die, or you dismiss them as a bonus action.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The affinity you chose for your Divine Magic feature determines the appearance of the spectral wings: eagle wings for good or law, bat wings for evil or chaos, and dragonfly wings for neutrality.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unearthly Recovery</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, you gain the ability to overcome grievous injuries. As a bonus action when you have fewer than half of your hit points remaining, you can regain a number of hit points equal to half your hit point maximum.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"divine-soul","classIdentifier":"sorcerer","advancement":[],"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"oU9dS4x0FAP6KDBX":3},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"subclassDefinitionId":109797427,"id":113,"importId":"18t7qb207aq558m4"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Divine Soul"}}}},{"_id":"mtxDpUYgFXjU2JOQ","name":"Sorcerer","type":"class","img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/fire_08.jpg","data":{"description":{"value":"<h1>Description</h1><p>A spellcaster who draws on inherent magic from a gift or bloodline</p>\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family:Roboto Condensed;font-size:14px\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d6<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong> Charisma<br /><strong>Saves:</strong> Constitution &amp; Charisma</p><h1>Class Features</h1>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice: </span></strong>1d6 per sorcerer level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level:</span></strong> 6 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</span></strong> 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per sorcerer level after 1st</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons:</span></strong> Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws:</span></strong> Constitution, Charisma<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills:</span></strong> Choose two from @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Arcana}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Deception}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Insight}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Intimidation}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Persuasion}, and @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Religion}</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic.

It appears like a translucent version of its living self.<br /><br /><strong><em>Task Driven.</em></strong> Although one is often mistaken for a ghost, a phantom warrior isn’t bound by a yearning to complete some unresolved goal. It can choose to end its undead existence at any time. Its spirit lingers willingly, either out of loyalty to its former master or because it believes it must perform a task to satisfy its honor or sense of duty. For example, a guard who dies defending a wall might return as a phantom warrior and continue guarding the wall, then disappear forever once a new guard assumes its post or the wall is destroyed. The period between the time it died and the time it rises as a phantom warrior is usually 24 hours.<br /><br /><strong><em>Faded Memories.</em></strong> A phantom warrior retains the alignment and personality it had before it died, and it remembers how it died. Memories of its life from shortly before it died are hazy, and older memories are forgotten. A phantom warrior can usually remember the last 1d10 + 10 days of its life; everything that happened before that is an impenetrable fog.<br /><br /><strong><em>Forceful Presence.</em></strong> Although they are incorporeal, phantom warriors can harness the energy around them to deflect incoming attacks and strike with great force. An invisible sheath of energy surrounds a phantom warrior’s ghostly armor, shields, and weapons, which become as hard as steel yet don’t impede the warrior’s ability to move through walls and other solid objects.<br /><br /><strong><em>Undead Nature.</em></strong> A phantom warrior doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br />","public":""},"alignment":"Any

It claws its way back into the world to seek revenge against the one who wronged it. The revenant reclaims its mortal body and superficially resembles a zombie. However, instead of lifeless eyes, a revenant’s eyes burn with resolve and flare in the presence of its adversary. If the revenant’s original body was destroyed or is otherwise unavailable, the spirit of the revenant enters another humanoid corpse. Regardless of the body the revenant uses as a vessel, its adversary always recognizes the revenant for what it truly is.<br /><br /><strong><em>Hunger for Revenge.</em></strong> A revenant has only one year to exact revenge. When its adversary dies, or if the revenant fails to kill its adversary before its time runs out, it crumbles to dust and its soul fades into the afterlife. If its foe is too powerful for the revenant to destroy on its own, it seeks worthy allies to help it fulfill its quest.<br /><br /><strong><em>Divine Justice.</em></strong> No magic can hide a creature pursued by a revenant, which always knows the direction and distance between it and the target of its vengeance. In cases where the revenant seeks revenge against more than one adversary, it pursues them one at a time, starting with the creature that dealt it the killing blow. If the revenant’s body is destroyed, its soul flies forth to seek out a new corpse in which to resume its hunt.<br /><br /><strong><em>Undead Nature.</em></strong> A revenant doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br /><br /><h3>Variant: Revenants with Spells and Weapons</h3>\nRevenants that were spellcasters before they died might retain some or all of their spellcasting capabilities. Similarly, revenants that wore armor and wielded weapons in life might continue to do so.<br /><br /><h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Regeneration</strong>: The revenant regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the revenant takes fire or radiant damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the revenant’s next turn. The revenant’s body is destroyed only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate.<br /><br /><strong>Rejuvenation</strong>: When the revenant’s body is destroyed, its soul lingers. After 24 hours, the soul inhabits and animates another corpse on the same plane of existence and regains all its hit points. While the soul is bodiless, a wish spell can be used to force the soul to go to the afterlife and not return.<br /><br /><strong>Turn Immunity</strong>: The revenant is immune to effects that turn undead.<br /><br /><strong>Vengeful Tracker</strong>: The revenant knows the distance to and direction of any creature against which it seeks revenge, even if the creature and the revenant are on different planes of existence. If the creature being tracked by the revenant dies, the revenant knows.<br /><br /><h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Multiattack</strong>: The revenant makes two fist attacks.<br /><br /><strong>Fist</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature against which the revenant has sworn vengeance, the target takes an extra 14, 4d6, bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the revenant can grapple the target, escape DC 14, provided the target is Large or smaller.<br /><br /><strong>Vengeful Glare</strong>: The revenant targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it and against which it has sworn vengeance. The target must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed until the revenant deals damage to it, or until the end of the revenant’s next turn. When the paralysis ends, the target is frightened of the revenant for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if it can see the revenant, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success.","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral","race":"","type":"undead","environment":"","cr":6,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":1800},"source":"Roll 20","class":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":["poison"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":["necrotic","psychic"],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["charmed","exhaustion","frightened","paralyzed","poisoned","stunned"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"perception":{"_deprecated":true}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13,"prof":0,"total":3},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14,"prof":0,"total":4},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14,"prof":0,"total":4},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13,"prof":0,"total":3},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14,"prof":0,"total":4},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13,"prof":0,"total":3},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13,"prof":0,"total":3},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14,"prof":0,"total":4},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14,"prof":0,"total":4},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13,"prof":0,"total":3}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"_deprecated":true,"max":0,"value":null}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Sir Godfrey Gwilym","displayName":40,"img":"moulinette/adventures/beneos-battlemaps-death-house-hd/beneos_battlemaps_assets/map_assets/tokens/placeholder.webp","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":65,"brightSight":60,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":null,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"dJ3owemHb7zPUpok","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false,"alpha":1,"x":null,"y":null,"elevation":null,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}}},"items":[{"_id":"M2RlOWM0YmRkNzli","name":"Regeneration.","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The revenant regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn.

zombies will not be able to reclaim a weapon should they be disarmed as the lack of weapon will simply drive them to claw with their broken hands.  The magic which binds the zombie to the mortal plane is tricky to the uninitiated as well, so please be warned young adventurers!  Should you fell a zombie, be aware that the creature may not be fully dead for the second time; you should always be sure to wait and see if the beast attempts to rise once more before wandering deeper into the dungeon.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral Evil","race":null,"type":{"value":"undead","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"Urban","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM pg. 316","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":["poison"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["poisoned"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"understands the languages it knew in life but can't speak"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"name":"Zombie","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":60,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightColor":null,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/undead/Zombie.webp","actorId":"NAISFPoNNgUCsEyW","alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}}},"items":[{"_id":"Ed7XgnZu9qRs3qdn","name":"Slam","type":"weapon","img":"icons/skills/melee/unarmed-punch-fist-yellow-red.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\"><p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+3 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.

It claws its way back into the world to seek revenge against the one who wronged it. The revenant reclaims its mortal body and superficially resembles a zombie. However, instead of lifeless eyes, a revenant’s eyes burn with resolve and flare in the presence of its adversary. If the revenant’s original body was destroyed or is otherwise unavailable, the spirit of the revenant enters another humanoid corpse. Regardless of the body the revenant uses as a vessel, its adversary always recognizes the revenant for what it truly is.<br /><br /><strong><em>Hunger for Revenge.</em></strong> A revenant has only one year to exact revenge. When its adversary dies, or if the revenant fails to kill its adversary before its time runs out, it crumbles to dust and its soul fades into the afterlife. If its foe is too powerful for the revenant to destroy on its own, it seeks worthy allies to help it fulfill its quest.<br /><br /><strong><em>Divine Justice.</em></strong> No magic can hide a creature pursued by a revenant, which always knows the direction and distance between it and the target of its vengeance. In cases where the revenant seeks revenge against more than one adversary, it pursues them one at a time, starting with the creature that dealt it the killing blow. If the revenant’s body is destroyed, its soul flies forth to seek out a new corpse in which to resume its hunt.<br /><br /><strong><em>Undead Nature.</em></strong> A revenant doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br /><br /><h3>Variant: Revenants with Spells and Weapons</h3>\nRevenants that were spellcasters before they died might retain some or all of their spellcasting capabilities. Similarly, revenants that wore armor and wielded weapons in life might continue to do so.<br /><br /><h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Regeneration</strong>: The revenant regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the revenant takes fire or radiant damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the revenant’s next turn. The revenant’s body is destroyed only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate.<br /><br /><strong>Rejuvenation</strong>: When the revenant’s body is destroyed, its soul lingers. After 24 hours, the soul inhabits and animates another corpse on the same plane of existence and regains all its hit points. While the soul is bodiless, a wish spell can be used to force the soul to go to the afterlife and not return.<br /><br /><strong>Turn Immunity</strong>: The revenant is immune to effects that turn undead.<br /><br /><strong>Vengeful Tracker</strong>: The revenant knows the distance to and direction of any creature against which it seeks revenge, even if the creature and the revenant are on different planes of existence. If the creature being tracked by the revenant dies, the revenant knows.<br /><br /><h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Multiattack</strong>: The revenant makes two fist attacks.<br /><br /><strong>Fist</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature against which the revenant has sworn vengeance, the target takes an extra 14, 4d6, bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the revenant can grapple the target, escape DC 14, provided the target is Large or smaller.<br /><br /><strong>Vengeful Glare</strong>: The revenant targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it and against which it has sworn vengeance. The target must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed until the revenant deals damage to it, or until the end of the revenant’s next turn. When the paralysis ends, the target is frightened of the revenant for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if it can see the revenant, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success.","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral","race":"","type":"undead","environment":"","cr":7,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":2900},"source":"Roll 20","class":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":["poison"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":["necrotic","psychic"],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["charmed","exhaustion","frightened","paralyzed","poisoned","stunned"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","draconic"],"custom":""},"perception":{"_deprecated":true}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13,"prof":0,"total":3},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14,"prof":0,"total":4},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14,"prof":0,"total":4},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13,"prof":0,"total":3},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14,"prof":0,"total":4},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13,"prof":0,"total":3},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13,"prof":0,"total":3},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14,"prof":0,"total":4},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14,"prof":0,"total":4},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13,"prof":0,"total":3}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"_deprecated":true,"max":0,"value":null}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Vladimir Horngaard","displayName":40,"img":"moulinette/adventures/beneos-battlemaps-death-house-hd/beneos_battlemaps_assets/map_assets/tokens/placeholder.webp","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":65,"brightSight":60,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":null,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"dQ79stxJRuSMmA7r","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false,"alpha":1,"x":null,"y":null,"elevation":null,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}}},"items":[{"_id":"M2RlOWM0YmRkNzli","name":"Regeneration.","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The revenant regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn.

This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you take the Attack action on your turn and use this special attack as part of it, you can spend 1 ki point to make the special attack twice as a bonus action.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain the Extra Attack feature, this special attack can be used for any of the attacks you make as part of the Attack action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Searing Arc Strike</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 6th level, you gain the ability to channel your ki into searing waves of energy. Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 2 ki points to cast the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\"><em>burning hands</em></span> spell as a bonus action.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend additional ki points to cast <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\"><em>burning hands</em></span> as a higher-level spell. Each additional ki point you spend increases the spell’s level by 1. The maximum number of ki points (2 plus any additional points) that you can spend on the spell equals half your monk level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Searing Sunburst</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 11th level, you gain the ability to create an orb of light that erupts into a devastating explosion. As an action, you magically create an orb and hurl it at a point you choose within 150 feet, where it erupts into a sphere of radiant light for a brief but deadly instant.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each creature in that 20-foot-radius sphere must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 radiant damage. A creature doesn’t need to make the save if the creature is behind total cover that is opaque.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can increase the sphere’s damage by spending ki points. Each point you spend, to a maximum of 3, increases the damage by 2d6.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sun Shield</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 17th level, you become wreathed in a luminous, magical aura. You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. You can extinguish or restore the light as a bonus action.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If a creature hits you with a melee attack while this light shines, you can use your reaction to deal radiant damage to the creature. The radiant damage equals 5 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"way-of-the-sun-soul","classIdentifier":"monk","advancement":[],"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"oU9dS4x0FAP6KDBX":3},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"subclassDefinitionId":108758231,"id":77,"importId":"wnlrq8jv0mgoqate"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Way of the Sun Soul"}}}},{"_id":"ip0nzmWpXdE5yLdq","name":"Monk","type":"class","img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg","data":{"description":{"value":"<h1>Description</h1><p>A master of martial arts, harnessing the power of the body in pursuit of physical and spiritual perfection</p>\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family:Roboto Condensed;font-size:14px\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d8<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong> Dexterity &amp; Wisdom<br /><strong>Saves:</strong> Strength &amp; Dexterity</p><h1>Class Features</h1>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice:</span></strong> 1d8 per monk level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level:</span></strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</span></strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per monk level after 1st</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons: </span></strong>Simple weapons, shortswords<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>Choose one type of artisan’s tools or one musical instrument<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Strength, Dexterity<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills:</span></strong> Choose two from @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Acrobatics}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Athletics}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{History}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Insight}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Religion}, and @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Stealth}</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Defense</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n\n<p><b>Martial Arts</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon in the <a title=\"Weapons\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#Weapons\">Weapons</a> section.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ki</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: <strong>Flurry of Blows</strong>, <strong>Patient Defense</strong>, and <strong>Step of the Wind</strong>. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Ki save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Flurry of Blows</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Patient Defense</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Step of the Wind</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Movement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.</p>\n\n<p><b>Monastic Tradition</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Deflect Missiles</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Slow Fall</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stunning Strike</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Stunned]{stunned} until the end of your next turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ki-Empowered Strikes</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>\n\n<p><b>Evasion</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">fireball</span> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stillness of Mind</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Charmed]{charmed} or @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Frightened]{frightened}.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Movement Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during your move.</p>\n\n<p><b>Purity of Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.</p>\n\n<p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.</p>\n\n<p><b>Diamond Soul</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeless Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.</p>\n\n<p><b>Empty Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Invisible]{invisible} for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">astral projection</span> spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can’t take any other creatures with you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Perfect Self</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.</p>\n\n<h1>Starting Equipment</h1>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a shortsword or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) any simple weapon</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted ParaOverride-7\">10 darts</li>\n</ul>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 76, Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide pg 35","identifier":"monk","levels":4,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"n9crsqbjzvff9e80","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"6e90qr940babwfwh","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"distance":{"units":""},"identifier":"martial-arts","type":"dice","scale":{"1":{"n":1,"die":4},"5":{"n":1,"die":6},"11":{"n":1,"die":8},"17":{"n":1,"die":10}}},"value":{},"title":"Martial Arts","icon":""}],"saves":["str","dex"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["acr","ath","his","ins","rel","ste"],"value":["ste","his"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"oU9dS4x0FAP6KDBX":3},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":108758231,"definitionId":11,"entityTypeId":1446578651,"importId":"wnlrq8jv0mgoqate"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Monk"}}}},{"_id":"oPh0vjNmvVDIgFNh","name":"Variant Human","type":"feat","img":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/9/387/636327460929201730.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races.

Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.</p> <p>Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn’t stand on its own—it’s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children.

Tribal warriors act not like the guards of the city gates; rather, they function on hierarchies of honor, physical prowess, and in the legacy of deeds won in battle. Equipped with simple weapons such as spears, shortswords, or blunt maces the tribal warrior thrives within the heat of a battle, relishing in the decimation of their enemies. Theirs is a world of power struggles played upon the field of war rather than behind the closed doors of a council chamber. While one on one fights may be availed to combatants who prove themselves a worthy challenge, the tribal warrior is often not far from their allies. Utilizing simple combat techniques to pincer or route adversaries, the tribal warrior is no stranger to guerilla combat. Should you enter a tribe's hard won territory it will be likely that the tribe was alerted miles ahead of your approach to their borders. Be cautious, be wise, and keep an eye upon the rustling trees of the roadways should you stray into a land most unfamiliar. Tribal warriors respect honor and might, should you show them both then bloodshed of a greater order may be quickly avoided.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"any alignment","race":null,"type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":null,"cr":0.125,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"MM pg. 350","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"any one language"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"name":"Tribal Warrior","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/TribalWarrior.webp","actorId":"nREPw9g94Bsb9sIl","alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}}},"items":[{"_id":"hbpux5uhl63ObLBg","name":"Hide Armor","type":"equipment","img":"icons/equipment/chest/breastplate-scale-leather.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts.

first time you see those hollow sockets staring back at you with some semblance of thought inside the skull, I advise to quash any feelings of accomplishment.  The skeletal servant you have raised is little more than a brainless husk.  Without proper, and I mean proper, instruction, the bones in front of you might as well have remained dusty upon the floor.  Explain the orders carefully and lay out the steps of your new servant's tasks with exceeding care.  Also, should you catch your skeletal friend partaking in the activities of their former life, do not scold them.  The mundane routine of chopping wood or swinging a hammer can allow for more malleable servants as time continues.<br /><em>The Book of Dark Servants, Vol III.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Skeletons are beings raised into undeath by the will of necromantic magic.  The necromantic magics used within the ritual can either be cast by a trained hand or simply seep into the bones of the skeleton in areas of concentrated death.  Cemeteries, catacombs, and battle fields are all subject to the sporadic rising of skeletons into their new lives.  The magic not only keeps the skeleton “living”, but it also binds joints and bones together like spectral ligaments.  With its second life, the skeleton acts as a semi-mindless creature serving its master's will.</p>\n<p><strong>Spooky Scary.</strong> For the up and coming necromancer, skeletons make worthy guards for a hidden repository of forbidden knowledge.  Skeletons will follow simple to mildly complex orders given (such as forming a protective circle or constructing minor defenses) without the necromancer needing to worry about the durability of their creations.  The skeletons will avoid danger and refuse to injure themselves unless explicitly ordered by their master.  Skeletons do seem to grow rather bored without direction and have been observed ambling around an area performing simple actions from their past lives.  One notable skeleton I recall was still able to cast their fishing line, though clumsily at best, into the nearby lake.  Skeletons, however, are not utilized for their prior skills but as guardians of the necromancer who summoned them back from the hells.  Skeletons are more than capable when swinging a sword or firing a crossbow, finding martial prowess in death that they may have lacked in life thanks to the dark power flowing through their marrow.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Author's Note: Not all skeletal adversaries in an adventurer's journey will be humanoid.  Be wary, as significant magics can summon back more

familiar to all whom read this tome and can come in thousands of various breeds and sizes.  What makes these little reptiles so very unique (and possibly a fine form for your familiar) is their ability to cling to a multitude of surfaces.  Adept at climbing, lizards may scale sheer surfaces and procure hidden vantage points from which to gaze down upon those you may wish to observe.  Some varieties of lizards are also able to shift the pigmentation of their flesh, allowing for further subterfuge options!  However, the humble lizard does not provide much in the way of offense as their bite is nothing more than a nuisance to most humanoids.  The lizard is perhaps best left to the shadows, where it may observe the world unseen for its clever master.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork

You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots.

A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.</p>\n\n<p><b>Pact Boon</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Metadata\">At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service.

You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Mystic Arcanum (7th level)</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 13th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum.
